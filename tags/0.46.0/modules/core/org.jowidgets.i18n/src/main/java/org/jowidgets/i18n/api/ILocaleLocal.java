 * A LocaleLocal is a variable that may have different values for each locale provided from the LocaleHolder.

 * Example: A ILocaleLocale can be used e.g. as a static variable, even if each web session of a web application server
 * has its own locale provided from the LocaleProvider. For each web session context, a own value will be created.
 * 
 * @param <VALUE_TYPE> The type of the object that is hold
